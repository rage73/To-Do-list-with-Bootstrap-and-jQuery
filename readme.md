# TO-DO LIST WITH BOOTSTRAP AND JQUERY

This is a to-do list made using Bootstrap and jQuery.

Once a task is added to the list it can be marked done by clicking on it. Subsequently, it can be marked undone when clicked on again.

It has four butt~ons which do as following:
1. Add items to list
2. Reset the input
3. Sort the done tasks to bottom
4. Clean up the done tasks from the list
